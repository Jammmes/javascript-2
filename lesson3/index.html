                    Reporter: 'What do you mean, Geoffrey?' G. Gilmore: 'Well, you <b>don't</b> need a lot of resources now to be able to make a movie with a pretty good production quality. There were always people in the past who made films for $5,000,
                    but not that many. Today, using a good consumer-level camera and a final cut pro program on a computer;you can make a movie with a high level of production quality.' Reporter: 'Do the creative giants of the past still dominate or has
                    a new generation truly taken hold?' G. Gilmore: 'The creative giants of the recent past still have an enormous power.' Reporter: 'There is a sense that <b>there's</b> been a change in the demographics of the film audience. <b>it's</b>                    wrong opinion.' G. Gilmore: 'You <b>aren't</b> say that the audience is getting older. That means more diverse and more moral challenging works are going to be permitted. I think the demographics are getting better.'
